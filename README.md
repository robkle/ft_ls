# ft_ls
A recode of the **ls** Unix command with some of its options.<br />
A coding exercise in interacting with the Unix file system using C. <br />
This program implements a binary search tree data stucture to sidestep tedious file sorting functions<br />
### Usage
The executable **ft_ls** is used the same way as **ls** Unix command, but only with -l, -R, -a, -r and -t options.<br />
./ft_ls \[-Ralt\] \[file ...\]<br /><br />
The repository contains a Makefile for:<br /> 
* compiling executable (**make all**)<br />
* removing object files (**make clean**)<br />
* deleting executable (**make fclean**)<br />
* recompiling (**make re**)<br />
#### Notes:
This project is part of my studies at Hive Helsinki. It was thoroughly tested by 5 fellow Hive students.
